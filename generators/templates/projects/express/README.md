# Getting Started with Node, Express and Visual Studio Code
This is an the [express-generator](http://expressjs.com/starter/generator.html) generated sample customized for development using [Visual Studio Code](http://code.visualstudio.com).  

This example illustrates:
- **Great IntelliSense**: [TypeScript definition files](https://github.com/borisyankov/DefinitelyTyped) provide IntelliSense for Node, Express, Mocha, and Gulp. Use [tsd](http://definitelytyped.org/tsd/) to install additional typings.
- **Test**: [Mocha](http://mochajs.org/) is a popular test framework for Node applications. Press Ctrl+Shift+T (Windows, Linux) or Cmd+Shift+T (OS X) to run the tests.
- **StyleSheets**: [Less](http://lesscss.org/) is a CSS pre-processor that extends CSS to allow for typical programming construcs such as variables, mixins, and functions. To compile your .less file to .css press Ctrl+Shift+T (Windows, Linux) or Cmd+Shift+T (OS X).
- **Debugging**: [Launch Configurations](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/debugging) are used for running your application under the debugger as well as launching the Mocha tests under the debugger. Open the Debug viewlet, select `Launch ./bin/www` or press `F5` to run the application.
- **Integration with existing tools**: [Task Configurations](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/tasks) allow for control over how individual [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) are launched. Run individual tasks from the Command Palette by pressing Ctrl+P (Windows, Linux) or Cmd+P (OS X) and typing in `task` and then press `space` to see all of the tasks in the provided `gulpfile.js`.
